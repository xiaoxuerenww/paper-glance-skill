## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Skill

> **What is a Skill?** A Skill is an instruction bundle that adds specialized capabilities to Claude. After upload, Claude detects and uses it automatically. Currently supported in **Claude Desktop** (with login).

1. Click `Code -> Download ZIP`, or download from Releases.
2. In Claude Desktop, open `Customize` -> `Skills` -> `Upload a skill`.
3. Upload the zip file. Done ✅

### Step 2: Use it

After installation, upload a paper PDF and send any message:

```text
"Help me read this paper"
"Generate a mindmap"
"Write a review"
"Create a promo post"
```

Claude will parse the paper and show the menu:

```text
📄 Paper loaded: "Attention Is All You Need" (2017)
> Replacing RNNs with self-attention, establishing the Transformer foundation.

## 📦 Feature Details

### 1 · 📊 Deep Analysis
A structured academic interpretation covering motivation, method design, key innovations, experiment setup/results, limitations, and future directions.

### 2 · 🧠 Mindmap
Generates a radial mindmap by default (problem -> method -> experiments -> contributions -> limitations). You can also request a method pipeline diagram. Both are standard Mermaid and can be edited in [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live).

### 3 · 🔍 Review Report
Outputs a conference/journal-style review:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Summary** | 3-5 objective sentences about problem, method, and conclusions |
| **Strengths** | 3-5 evidence-backed strengths |
| **Weaknesses** | 3-5 weaknesses, each with improvement suggestions |
| **Questions** | 3-5 questions for the authors |
| **Minor Comments** | Optional minor issues |
| **Decision** | Accept / Weak Accept / Borderline / Weak Reject / Reject + rationale |

### 4 · 📢 Promo Scripts
One-click generation for multiple formats: Twitter/X post (with hashtags), blog/social summary, academic talk opening, and email summary.

### 5 · 🎙️ Podcast Script + Audio
Converts paper content into podcast-ready narration:

- Solo host narration (science explainer style)
- Dual-host dialog (Host x Expert)

If `better-tts-mcp` is connected, it can generate MP3 directly. Otherwise it automatically falls back to text-only script mode.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need an API key or paid plugin?**
No. All core capabilities rely on Claude's native abilities.

**Q: Does it support English papers?**
Yes. It supports both Chinese and English papers, and output language can be specified.

**Q: Mermaid mindmap does not render in my client.**
Use the latest Claude Desktop version, or copy Mermaid code to [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live).

**Q: Why wasn't MP3 generated for podcast mode?**
TTS MCP is likely not connected. In that case the skill falls back to script-only mode. Install and connect: `https://github.com/CatVinci-Studio/better-tts-mcp`
